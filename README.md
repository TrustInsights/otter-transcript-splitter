# Otter Transcript Splitter

For users of [Otter.ai](https://www.trustinsights.ai/otter) that want to split up transcripts by speaker, this is a handy way to take any Otter plain text transcript and split it into individual speaker files. Each speaker's text will be added to a text file of that speaker's name, in chronological order.

Now, you might be asking, what in the world good is something like this? Why would you ever use this?

Well, if you're building, say, Custom GPTs, and you want to build a corpus of one particular speaker... this is how you feed that corpus.
